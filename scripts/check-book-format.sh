# Formatting gate for the manuscript's Bynk snippet projects.
#
# Every listing in the book is typeset from the file on disk — the chapters
# `read()` the snippet sources directly — so a snippet's whitespace is printed
# whitespace. The compile gate (scripts/check-book-snippets.sh) proves each
# listing is the program its chapter claims; it says nothing about how that
# program is laid out. Without this gate a hand-edited snippet drifts from
# canonical Bynk and the book prints non-idiomatic code while CI stays green.
#
# This runs `bynkc fmt --check` over the snippet projects that are expected to
# compile: every project not listed in snippets/EXPECTATIONS.tsv, plus the ones
# listed there as `warn`. The deliberately-rejected `fail` projects are skipped
# — they exist to be refused, and a future negative fixture may not parse at
# all, which the formatter cannot process. Their listings are printed in the
# book too, so that exemption is a real (small) hole, not a claim of coverage.
#
# `bynkc fmt` formats files, not directories, so the file list is enumerated
# here rather than delegated to project discovery. `--check` writes nothing: it
# exits non-zero and names each file that is not already canonical.
#
# Chapters 1-8 predate the formatter and are not canonical yet. They cannot
# simply be reformatted: six chapters print listings by slicing hard-coded line
# ranges out of these files (`source-lines(path, start, end)`), and formatting
# shifts those lines — it breaks the Typst build where a range runs off the end
# of a file, and silently prints the wrong lines where it does not. So the
# projects still to be reformatted are listed in snippets/FORMAT-BASELINE and
# reported without failing.
#
# The baseline is a ratchet, not an exemption list: a baselined project that
# has become canonical *fails*, with a note to delete its line. It can only
# shrink, and everything outside it is gated from today.
#
# The compiler is whichever `bynkc` is on PATH; override with
# BYNKC=/path/to/bynkc. In CI, bynk-lang/setup-bynk installs a pinned release.
# The formatter ships with the compiler, so canonical layout is defined by the
# same release the diagnostics are quoted from — its version is printed below.
