# Emit-gate for the manuscript's Bynk snippet projects.
#
# check-book-snippets.sh runs `bynkc check`, which proves a program is
# accepted. It does not prove the program can be built: a listing can pass
# `check` and still emit TypeScript that `tsc` rejects (accuser/bynk#1818 is one
# such case). A chapter presents its listings as working programs, so this gate
# compiles every project expected to pass, for both topologies the book
# discusses (`bundle` and `workers`), and type-checks the output with
# `tsc --strict` through the tsconfig.json the compiler emits.
#
# The deliberately-rejected `fail` projects in snippets/EXPECTATIONS.tsv are
# skipped; they exist to be refused.
#
# `bynkc compile` writes bynk.schema.lock into the project it compiles, so each
# project is copied to a temporary directory first and the snippets tree is
# never written to.
#
# Builds listed in snippets/EMIT-BASELINE are known to fail. They are reported
# without failing the gate, and a listed build that starts to pass fails it with
# a note to delete its line, so the baseline can only shrink.
#
# The compiler is whichever `bynkc` is on PATH; override with
# BYNKC=/path/to/bynkc. TypeScript is whichever `tsc` is on PATH; override with
# TSC=/path/to/tsc (CI pins a version through npx).
