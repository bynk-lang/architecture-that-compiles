# Bynk print manuscript

This directory contains the source of a narrative, print-first book about the
problems Bynk is designed to address and the choices it makes in addressing
them.

It is deliberately separate from the online Bynk Book in `site/`:

- the online Book teaches and documents Bynk;
- this manuscript develops an argument about service design, with Bynk as its
  worked answer;
- documentation may inform the manuscript, but prose is not imported or shared
  mechanically between them.

The title, subtitle, structure, trim, and component vocabulary are provisional
while the manuscript finds its shape.

## Source structure

- `main.typ` assembles the manuscript.
- `metadata.typ` holds working publication metadata.
- `template.typ` owns page design and semantic presentation rules.
- `frontmatter/`, `chapters/`, and `backmatter/` contain publishable text.
- `notes/` contains editorial planning and source maps, not manuscript prose.
- `snippets/` contains book-specific Bynk programs and fragments.
- `syntaxes/` contains the Bynk highlighting grammar the template loads for
  `.bynk` listings (a presentation aid scoped to what the book prints, mirroring
  the editor grammar and keyword registry; not a parser).
- `figures/` contains original book artwork.
- `fonts/` contains the fixed, licensed Source faces used for typesetting.
- `build/` is ignored local output.

Chapter files should describe meaning, not page geometry. New visual components
belong in `template.typ`; they should only be added when real manuscript content
demands them.

## Build

Build the manuscript from anywhere in the worktree:

```sh
./scripts/build-book.sh
```

The PDF is written to `output/pdf/bynk-manuscript.pdf`. For continuous preview
while writing:

```sh
./scripts/build-book.sh watch
```

The generated PDF and downloaded toolchain are not committed.

The build is pinned to **Typst 0.15.0**. If that exact version is already on
`PATH`, the script uses it. Otherwise, on macOS or Linux (arm64 or x86_64), it
downloads the official release, verifies its SHA-256 digest, and caches the
binary under `book/build/toolchain/`. Set `BYNK_TYPST_BIN` to use an exact Typst
0.15.0 executable on another platform.

Optional environment overrides:

- `BYNK_TYPST_BIN` selects an exact Typst 0.15.0 executable.
- `BYNK_BOOK_OUTPUT` changes the generated PDF path.
- `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` sets the PDF creation timestamp. When omitted in a Git
  checkout, the build derives a stable timestamp from the latest manuscript or
  build-script commit.

CI runs the same command when manuscript, font, or build-script inputs change.
The resulting PDF is uploaded to the workflow run as the `bynk-manuscript`
artifact (14-day retention). To download and open the newest CI-built PDF for
your branch without hunting through the Actions UI:

```sh
./scripts/fetch-book-pdf.sh          # newest build for the current branch (or main)
./scripts/fetch-book-pdf.sh --watch  # wait for an in-flight run to finish first
```

It needs the GitHub CLI (`gh auth login`). The PDF is a CI artifact only — it is
not published to a public URL.

### Source fonts

The manuscript uses Source Serif 4 Small Text for narrative text, Source Serif
4 Display for chapter and book titles, Source Serif 4 Caption for footnotes,
Source Sans 3 for section headings and book furniture, and Source Code Pro for
listings, inline code, and diagnostics. There is no alternate typography
setting.

The ten static OpenType faces used by the manuscript are vendored in `fonts/`.
The build ignores system fonts and verifies these files before compiling, so
local and CI line breaks do not depend on machine state. Their exact versions,
upstream archives, checksums, copyright notices, and SIL Open Font License 1.1
are recorded in that directory.

## Working principles

1. Begin with the engineering problem; introduce Bynk as a response.
2. Use code as evidence, not as a disguised reference manual.
3. Show compiler refusals where they reveal the language's design.
4. State costs and counterarguments alongside benefits.
5. Prefer one evolving system over disconnected feature demonstrations.
6. Keep exact syntax and exhaustive reference material in the online Book.
7. Compile-test every listing presented as a complete program.
8. Use sentence case for book, part, chapter, and section titles.

See `notes/brief.md` for the current editorial proposition,
`notes/source-map.md` for the boundary between research material and manuscript
prose, and `notes/typography.md` for the current typographic specification.
